# Strict No-Refund & No-Cancellation Policy

**Last Updated: December 19, 2025**

Thank you for choosing Law Genie. We value your trust and strive to provide the best legal assistance services.

### **IMPORTANT NOTICE:**
**By purchasing a subscription or service on Law Genie, you acknowledge and agree that all sales are final. We enforce a strict "No Refund" and "No Cancellation" policy.**

---

## 1. No Cancellations
- **Finality of Purchase:** Once a subscription plan (Monthly, Yearly, or any other duration) is purchased, it cannot be cancelled or terminated by the user before its expiry date.
- **Commitment:** The subscription is a commitment for the selected duration. You will continue to have access to premium features until the plan expires automatically.
- **No Partial Cancellations:** We do not offer the option to pause, stop, or cancel a plan mid-term for a partial refund.

## 2. No Refunds
- **All Sales Are Final:** We do not provide refunds for any subscription, service, or feature purchased within the app.
- **Usage:** This policy applies regardless of whether you have used the premium features or not.
- **Exceptions:** We do not grant refunds for accidental purchases, change of mind, or dissatisfaction with the service features, as all features are clearly described before purchase.

## 3. Duplicate Payment Exception
- The **ONLY** exception to this policy is in the case of a technical error resulting in a **duplicate payment** (i.e., you were charged twice for the same transaction).
- **Process:** If a duplicate deduction occurs, please email us immediately at **support@lawgenie.co.in** with proof of both transactions (Transaction IDs from Razorpay/Bank).
- **Resolution:** After verification, the duplicate amount will be refunded to your original payment method within **7-10 working days**.
