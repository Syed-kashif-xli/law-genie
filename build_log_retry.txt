Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.24) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a version of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\Users\veo18\Desktop\Law\law-genie\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\Users\veo18\Desktop\Law\law-genie\android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.

This application cannot tree shake icons fonts. It has non-constant instances of IconData at the following locations:
  - file:///C:/Users/veo18/Desktop/Law/law-genie/lib/models/timeline_event.dart:54:13
Target aot_android_asset_bundle failed: Error: Avoid non-constant invocations of IconData or try to build again with --no-tree-shake-icons.
