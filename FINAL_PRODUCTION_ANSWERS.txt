### Question 1: How did you recruit users for your closed test?

**Answer:**
"I recruited 12 testers from my personal network, ensuring a mix of technical and non-technical users.
1. **Law Students:** I invited students from my law college to verify the accuracy of the 'AI Jurist' and 'Case Search' features.
2. **General Users:** I included friends and family members to test the app's ease of use and navigation.
I reached out to them directly via WhatsApp and personal calls, explaining that I needed honest feedback on both the legal content and the app's performance."

### Question 2: How did you engage testers and get feedback?

**Answer:**
"I maintained an active feedback loop through a WhatsApp broadcast list. Instead of passive testing, I assigned specific tasks such as 'Generate a Rent Agreement' or 'Test the Voice Search feature.' I encouraged testers to report verify bugs via screenshots on WhatsApp and to leave suggestion-based reviews on the Play Store. This direct communication allowed me to understand issues (like OTP delays) in real-time and release quick fixes."

### Question 3: What feedback did you receive and how did you address it?

**Answer:**
"We gathered crucial insights during the 14-day period:
1. **OTP Delays (v1.0.0+4):** Tester 'Iqra Ali' reported slow OTP delivery. We optimized our authentication flow in version 1.0.0+5 to resolve this.
2. **Content Gaps:** Tester 'Suhani' suggested adding more specific local laws. We have acknowledged this and prioritized it for our next content update.
3. **Usage Counter Bug:** A critical bug where daily limits showed '0' was reported privately by multiple testers. We fixed the database synchronization logic and confirmed the fix with the testers.
All critical stability issues have been resolved."

### Question 4: Why is your app ready for production?

**Answer:**
"Law Genie is ready because we have moved beyond 'feature testing' to 'stability assurance.' Over the last 14 days, we have:
1. Achieved a **crash-free experience** across different devices (Samsung, OnePlus, Nothing Phone).
2. Received a **4.8-star average rating** from our 12 testers, validating the app's value.
3. Successfully resolved all functional blockers (OTP & Usage tracking).
We are confident that the app delivers a polished, compliant, and helpful experience for users."
